Music Theory
============

"Music Theory" (**musictheory**) is a package designed to investigate the 
question "Which chords go with which scales?" A couple of years ago, 
the author was very interested and obsessed in the question, and decided
to put his Python skills to the task. Along the way, the **musictheory** 
package was redesigned to be more flexible and extendible. 

The package has roughly the same philosophy as `Music Set Theory 
<http://www.jaytomlin.com/music/settheory/help.html>`_ but uses different
terminology.

Documentation
-------------
